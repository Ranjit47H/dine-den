    <pre class="mine">
        Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. 
The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
Following several early private testing versions, 
it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, 
with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. 
Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold
 and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021 and has been ported to several platforms.

Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the 
greatest video games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, 
and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. 
The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, 
and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased 
by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including 
Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft Legends.
